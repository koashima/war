<h2>About</h2>
WAR is a browser-based game of the card game by the same name.
It is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- The DOM (handling events, manipulation, etc)
- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS Grid and Flex

<h2>Project Status</h2>
WAR passed all the academic requirements, but I might still add features like: 

- Overlays for beginning and end of game.
- Animated card flips
