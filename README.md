## Background

War, the card game, is a classic, nonviolent take on war. Each player flips over a card, and whoever has the highest card wins. 
<br>
If it's a tie... Settle it with rational debate???
<br>
NO WAY! 
<br>
Just put three more cards down and whoever has the highest card takes it all! 
<br>
The first player who has no cards left loses. (There is mercy in this web app, if a player only has 2 cards left they lose.)
